          <p>
            <strong>IN botany</strong>,
            <em> tree is a perennial plant with an elongated stem</em>, or
            trunk,<br />
            usually supporting
            <a

              >branches and leaves.</a
            >
            In some usages, the definition of a tree may be narrower,<br />
            including only woody plants with secondary growth, plants that are
            usable as lumber or plants above a specified height.<br />
            In wider definitions, the taller palms, tree ferns, bananas, and
            bamboos are also trees.
          </p>
          <p>
            Trees are not<strong> a monophyletic taxonomic </strong> group but
            consist of a wide variety of plant<br />
            species that have independently evolved a trunk and branches as a
            way to tower above <br />
            other plants to compete for<a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunlight"
              >sunlight</a
            >. The majority of tree species are angiosperms or hardwoods;>br> of
            the rest,<em> many are gymnosperms or softwoods</em>. Trees tend to
            be long-lived, some reaching several thousand years old.<br />
            Trees have been in existence for 370 million years. It is estimated
            that there are around three trillion mature trees in the world.
